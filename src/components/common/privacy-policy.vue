    <h2 class="pl-50"><i>How we use and share data collected from the website or social media</i></h2>
    <p>THREAD uses data collected on the THREAD website or from social media to:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>allow you to contact us,</li>
        <li>respond to a demonstration request,</li>
        <li>respond to a help desk request,</li>

          <li>When THREAD needs to share data to satisfy a legal or regulatory requirement.  If THREAD is involved in a merger, acquisition or any transfer or sale of some or all of its business, we may share your data in connection with that transaction.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>THREAD maintains this information only for so long as we have a legitimate business need or for so long as a contract with a study sponsor requires.</p>
      <h2 class="addUnderline"><i>THREAD Registration Sites</i></h2>
      <h2 class="pl-50"><i>Data collected from a registration site</i></h2>
      <p>Study sponsors engage THREAD to pre-screen prospective candidates to participate in a clinical research study.  This is known as a registration site, or, sometimes a recruitment site.  The study sponsor or other member of the study team determines the content on their registration site.  THREAD maintains these sites on behalf of the study sponsor and collects personal data on their behalf. </p>
      <p>THREAD and the study team have entered into a legal agreement that addresses the handling or your personal data.</p>
      <p>THREAD collects personal data necessary to determine whether you qualify for the study.  You submit this personal data in response to the questions asked on the registration website.  The study team determines what data it needs to qualify candidates and the questions to be asked – THREAD does not.</p>
      <p>THREAD uses a knowledge-based authentication (KBA) service to verify the identity of a prospective candidate.  The KBA asks the prospective candidate to select questions and answers that are used to verify that she is who she says she is and is authorized to use the participant web.</p>
      <p>THREAD does not share the questions provided to the KBA service, or the prospective candidates answers.  THREAD only processes the fact of whether the prospective candidate has passed the verification.</p>
      <p>Further questions are asked to determine if the potential candidate satisfies other qualification criteria.  These criteria are specified by the study sponsor.  THREAD only provides the study team with the results of the registration process and the personal data of qualifying individuals.  The information that may be collected includes, but is not necessarily limited to: name, pass or fail outcome to the verification questions, and responses to qualification criteria determined by the study team. This data is used by the study team to place prospective participants in research studies.</p>
      <p>Once qualified you will be asked to provide contact information in order to ship study materials to you.  This information may include, but is not necessarily limited to: your name, mailing address, phone number and email address.</p>
      
      <h2 class="pl-50"><i>How We Use and share data collected from a registration site</i></h2>
      <p>Data collected on a registration site is processed and made available for the principal investigator in order to place prospective participants in research studies.</p>
      <p>We share data from a registration site in these ways:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>When you ask us to share it, for example, in order to make your application available to a primary investigator;</li>
          <li>When THREAD hires a service provider to help operate our business, we may need to give them access to information to provide their services;</li>
          <li>When THREAD needs to share data to satisfy a legal or regulatory requirement.  If THREAD is involved in a merger, acquisition or any transfer or sale of some or all of its business, we may share your data in connection with that transaction.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>THREAD maintains this information for the longer of 1) only for so long as we have a legitimate business need for it or 2) for as long as the study team may require which may be as long as 25 years if you qualify as a participant.</p>
    
      <h2 class="addUnderline"><i>Study Applications</i></h2>
      <h2 class="pl-50"><i>Data collected from a Study Application</i></h2>
      <p>THREADS customers, like a study sponsor or clinical research organization (the “study team”) may use the THREAD platform to create a study application for use by their study participants.  THREAD maintains these applications and collects personal information on behalf of the study team.  These study team, customized, applications collect certain types of information, including, but not necessarily limited to:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data generated or collected from a participant’s mobile device sensors, including accelerometer, gyroscope, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, camera, compass, and barometer</li>
          <li>Data and information collected by the study application, such as a participant’s responses to survey questions; and</li>
          <li>Data and information from a third-party FDA-listed medical device, consumer wearable device, health application or similar device, wearable or tool that collects data and information from the participant.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>THREAD does not always know exactly what data the study team collects via a particular study application.  THREAD uses and stores personal data collected through any device or application only in de-identified, tokenized form, and may share personal data with the study team for purpose of carrying out the study.</p>
      <p>THREAD also requires that participants provide an email address for login purposes and in order to retrieve a forgotten password.</p>
      <p>We also share application data in these instances:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>When THREAD hires a service provider to help operate our business, we may need to give them access to information to provide their services;</li>
          <li>When THREAD needs to share data to satisfy a legal or regulatory requirement; or </li>
          <li>If THREAD is involved in a merger, acquisition or any transfer or sale of some or all of its business, we may share your data in connection with that transaction.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>THREAD maintains this information only for so long as we have a legitimate business need or for so long as a contract with a study sponsor requires.  This may be as long as 25 years if you qualify as a participant.</p>

      <h2 class="pl-50"><i>Study applications & Information about Children</i></h2>
      <p>Study applications are not intended for, nor designed to attract, individuals under the age of 18.  We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we know to be under the age of 18 without explicit consent from their parent or guardian. In cases when our study applications are used by individuals under that age of 18, we require our customers to obtain such consent prior to use.</p>

      <h2 class="addUnderline"><i>The THREAD Platform</i></h2>
      <h2 class="pl-50"><i>The Information collected from the THREAD Platform</i></h2>
      <p>THREAD hosts our software-as-a-service platform on behalf of third-party researchers and companies around the world for use in marketing and medical research.

        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>THREAD stores this data in a de-identified form.  De-identified means your identity is removed and a randomly generated number is substituted then the record is tokenized prior to storage on our platform. De-identified data is available to sponsors. Only a principal investigator can access this data in identified form, and a principal investigator will not share the data with THREAD unless required by applicable law to do so.</p>
      <p>THREAD also requires that customers, principal investigators or a customer’s outsourced third parties provide an email address and phone number for login purposes and to retrieve a forgotten password.
