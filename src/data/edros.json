    "description": "In the Tower of Hanoi task, the user is asked to solve the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle in a minimum number of moves. To solve the puzzle, the user must move the entire stack to the highlighted platform in as few moves as possible. This task measures the user’s problem solving skills. A Tower of Hanoi task finishes when the user completes the puzzle correctly or concedes that they cannot solve the puzzle. Data collected by this task is in the form of an ORKTowerOfHanoiResult object. It contains every move taken by the user and indicates whether the puzzle was successfully completed or not.",
